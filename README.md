# Line-Tracker-Rpi-Propeller
Designing an autonomous robot that will drive around the streets
of Manhattan to find enemy intruders (the enemies) among us who are troubling the civilians (the
friendlies) in the city. The robot must lookout for the enemies and eliminate them by scouring through
the streets while following all the traffic rules and should avoid obstacles (if any)
